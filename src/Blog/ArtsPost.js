                                        <p class="text-muted mb-0 font-italic">“We have always been interested in the power of social change and engaging with the community,” says Kyle, who has a degree in political science and government. “Performing from a pickup truck allowed us to challenge the notion that voting, like theatre, is a luxury only relevant to some.”</p>
                                    </blockquote>
                                    <p class="text-muted">The effort was made possible through a grant from Citizen University in Seattle, a nonprofit that promotes and teaches the art of powerful citizenship. It’s also a collaboration between Kyle, who acts in the show, and other local actors: Katie Beck of Gum-Dip Theatre, John Dayo-Aliya from Ma ‘Sue Productions, and Mercedes Littell. They put on 10 performances across different parking lots and neighborhoods in Akron, exploring the many facets that make up the culture of voting.

Five scenes, transitioned with song, included physical comedy and a clownish debate between the characters Ima B. Voting and Don T. Matters. And woven throughout the content, audiences were treated to the facts and history of voting.



At each performance, a volunteer was on hand offering audience members the opportunity to register to vote.

At one of the performances, Kyle recalls there was a group of people who had just been released from prison. “They were not registered to vote, and weren’t even sure if they could register, but we explained they could, and they did. It was pretty powerful.”</p>
